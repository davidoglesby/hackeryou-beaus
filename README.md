  Client: Beau’s (http://beaus.ca)
  - Brief: Beau’s has hired you to create an application that highlights their seasonal beverages. 
    Their most well-known brand is Lug Tread, which is not a seasonal beer, so they want to 
    exclude Lug Tread from the application. Beau’s wants you to display all of the beers that 
    are available through the LCBO. When a user selects one, they want you to provide a 
    description and also show the stores that carry that particular beer. If you have time, 
    also provide a feature that allows the user to get directions to the store they select.
